   .venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # Mac/Linux
   source .venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies:**

   - Go to https://aistudio.google.com/
   - Sign in with your Google account
   - Click 'Get API key' in the left sidebar
   - Create a new API key
   - Create a `.env` file in the project root:
     ```
     # Google AI Studio API Key (FREE!)
     GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
     
     # Time range for news fetching (in hours, default: 120 = 5 days)
     HOURS_BACK=120
     ```

6. **Run the application:**
   ```bash
   python tech_news_fetcher.py
   ```
