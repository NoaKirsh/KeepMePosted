# Cursor AI Rules for KeepMePosted

## Project Context
This is an AI-powered tech newsletter application using Google Gemini.
Two-agent system: NewsCollectorAgent (RSS feeds) and NewsSummarizerAgent (AI summaries).

## Code Style & Standards
- Python 3.8+ with type hints (typing module)
- Async/await patterns for I/O operations
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use descriptive variable names
- Keep functions focused and under 50 lines when possible

## Code Quality
- Strive for generic, reusable code by abstracting common logic into functions or classes.
- Eliminate code duplication and redundancy; refactor repeated patterns into shared utilities.
- Ensure code is modular, maintainable, and easy to extend.
- Use clear, descriptive names for variables, functions, and classes.
- Adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle: each function or class should have one clear purpose.

## Architecture Principles
- Agent-based design: Each agent has clear responsibilities
- Configuration in `config.py`, not hardcoded
- Environment variables for secrets (via .env)
- Graceful error handling with logging
- No blocking I/O in async functions

## Testing & Debugging
- Test with small article limits first (max_articles=3)
- Check API key validity before running
- Log errors with context (source, article title, etc.)
- Validate RSS feed responses before parsing

## AI Integration Guidelines
- Google Gemini API calls should have timeout handling
- Use safety_settings to control content filtering
- Keep prompts focused and structured
- Handle API rate limits gracefully
- Provide fallback behavior if AI fails

## Dependencies
- Minimize external dependencies
- Pin versions in requirements.txt
- Document why each dependency is needed
- Prefer standard library when possible

## Security
- Never commit .env file
- Validate all external inputs (RSS feeds)
- Sanitize article content before AI processing
- Use environment variables for all secrets

## Performance
- Fetch RSS feeds concurrently when possible
- Limit article processing to configured max
- Cache AI responses if implementing repeated runs
- Use efficient data structures (dicts for grouping)

## Documentation
- Docstrings for all classes and public methods
- Inline comments for complex logic only
- Keep README updated with setup instructions
- Document configuration options in config.py
